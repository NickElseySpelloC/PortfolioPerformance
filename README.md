# Portfolio Performance Reporting
This app generates a simple performance report for your investment portfolio, including:
- Overall change in value over the past # days
- Change in value of each asset class 
- Top N winners - the individual holdings that have improved the most over the past # days
- Top N losers

## Input Files
This app needs two input data sources:
1. Portfolio Holdings: An Excel file listing the individual holdings (stocks, funds, cash) in your investment portfolio. 
2. Price Data Files: One or more CSV files providing current and historic price data for the stocks and funds in your investment portfolio. These data can be obtained from Yahoo Finance, etc. 

See below for more information.

## Portfolio Holdings File(s)
These must be Excel file(s) containing one or more data ranges that collectively defined the current holdings in your investment portfolio. You can import portfolio data from one or more Excel files and/or ranges. 

Each range in the Excel file can be one of:
- An entire worksheet, or
- An Excel table, or
- A named range

The following columns are expected in each import range:
**Symbol**: The symbol (code) for the holding, as used in the Price Data files. For example _MSFT_. If the holding is cash, use CASH as the symbol. 

**Name**: The name of this holding, for example _Microsoft, Inc._

**Class**: The asset class that this holding falls in. This can be any arbitary name that you use to categorise your portfolio holdings into, for example _Equities: International_

**Currency**: The currency that this investment is denominated in, for example _USD_

**Units Held**: The number of units / shares you currently hold, for example: _1000_

**Cost Basis**: The total cost basis for your entire holding, as stated in the base (reporting) currency, for example _352300_. 

The Cost Basis column is optional, everything else is required.

The path to your Portfolio Holdings files is specified in the _PortfolioImport_ section of the config file (see below).

## Price Data Files
These must be CSV file(s) containing a range of historic prices for stocks and funds that you hold. The files can hold any amount of history but must go back at least the number of days covering the comparision period of the report.  

The app will uses these data to lookup the current and prior price for each holding, plus FX rates to convert international holdings to your base currency. If a record isn't available for the specific date that we are pricing a portfolio for, the app will use the most recent price prior to that date.

The following columns are expected in CSV file:
**Symbol**: The symbol (code) for the holding, for example _MSFT_. For FX rates, the symbol must be in the format used by Yahoo Finance, for example _AUDUSD=X_ to convert from AUD to USD, or _GBP=X_ to convert from USD to GBP.
  
**Date**: The effective date of this price, in the format YYYY-MM-DD, for example 2025-05-07 for 7th July 2025.

**Name**: The name of this holding, for example _Microsoft, Inc._

**Currency**: The currency that this investment is denominated in, for example _USD_

**Pric**: The price of this asset as at the specified date.
